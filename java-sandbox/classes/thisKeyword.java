this keyword cannot be assigned any new value
eg.
this = foo //wrong

objName.method() implicitly passes an object (objName as a parameter called "this".

Note: static doesnot pass an object as a parameter.
      therefore in static method context, any objects field and methods cannot be used
      unless an object is passed explicitly to the static metjod in context.
