Arrays

An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. 
The length of an array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed. 

Each item in an array is called an element, and each element is accessed by its numerical index. 

The following program, ArrayDemo, creates an array of integers, puts some values in it, and prints each value to 
standard output.

class ArrayDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // declares an array of integers
        int[] anArray;

        // allocates memory for 10 integers
        anArray = new int[10];
           
        // initialize first element
        anArray[0] = 100;
        // initialize second element
        anArray[1] = 200;
        // etc.
        anArray[2] = 300;
        anArray[3] = 400;
        anArray[4] = 500;
        anArray[5] = 600;
        anArray[6] = 700;
        anArray[7] = 800;
        anArray[8] = 900;
        anArray[9] = 1000;

        System.out.println("Element at index 0: "
                           + anArray[0]);
        System.out.println("Element at index 1: "
                           + anArray[1]);
        System.out.println("Element at index 2: "
                           + anArray[2]);
        System.out.println("Element at index 3: "
                           + anArray[3]);
        System.out.println("Element at index 4: "
                           + anArray[4]);
        System.out.println("Element at index 5: "
                           + anArray[5]);
        System.out.println("Element at index 6: "
                           + anArray[6]);
        System.out.println("Element at index 7: "
                           + anArray[7]);
        System.out.println("Element at index 8: "
                           + anArray[8]);
        System.out.println("Element at index 9: "
                           + anArray[9]);
    }
} 

The output from this program is:
Element at index 0: 100
Element at index 1: 200
Element at index 2: 300
Element at index 3: 400
Element at index 4: 500
Element at index 5: 600
Element at index 6: 700
Element at index 7: 800
Element at index 8: 900
Element at index 9: 1000

//<------------     Declaring a Variable to Refer to an Array:     ----------------->

The above program declares anArray with the following line of code:
// declares an array of integers
int[] anArray;

Like declarations for variables of other types, an array declaration has two components: 
the array's type and the array's name. An arrays type is written as type[], where type is the data type of the 
contained elements; the square brackets are special symbols indicating that this variable holds an array. 
The size of the array is not part of its type (which is why the brackets are empty). 
As with variables of other types, the declaration does not actually create an array â€” it simply tells the compiler 
that this variable will hold an array of the specified type.

Similarly, you can declare arrays of other types:
byte[] anArrayOfBytes;
short[] anArrayOfShorts;
long[] anArrayOfLongs;
float[] anArrayOfFloats;
double[] anArrayOfDoubles;
boolean[] anArrayOfBooleans;
char[] anArrayOfChars;
String[] anArrayOfStrings;

You can also place the square brackets after the arrays name:
// this form is discouraged
float anArrayOfFloats[];

However, convention discourages this form; the brackets identify the array type and should appear with the type designation.



//<------------------   Creating, Initializing, and Accessing an Array:     --------------------->


One way to create an array is with the new operator. The next statement in the ArrayDemo program allocates an 
array with enough memory for ten integer elements and assigns the array to the anArray variable.
// create an array of integers
anArray = new int[10];

Alternatively, you can use the shortcut syntax to create and initialize an array:
int[] anArray = { 
    100, 200, 300,
    400, 500, 600, 
    700, 800, 900, 1000
};

Here the length of the array is determined by the number of values provided between { and }.

You can also declare an array of arrays (also known as a multidimensional array) by using two or more sets of 
square brackets, such as String[][] names. Each element, therefore, must be accessed by a corresponding number of 
index values.

In the Java programming language, a multidimensional array is simply an array whose components are themselves arrays. 
This is unlike arrays in C or Fortran. A consequence of this is that the rows are allowed to vary in length, 
as shown in the following MultiDimArrayDemoprogram:
class MultiDimArrayDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[][] names = {
            {"Mr. ", "Mrs. ", "Ms. "},
            {"Smith", "Jones"}
        };
        // Mr. Smith
        System.out.println(names[0][0] + names[1][0]);
        // Ms. Jones
        System.out.println(names[0][2] + names[1][1]);
    }
}

The output from this program is:
Mr. Smith
Ms. Jones

Finally, you can use the built-in length property to determine the size of any array. The code
 System.out.println(anArray.length);

will print the arrays size to standard output.



//<-----------------    Copying Arrays:     --------------------->


The System (class) has an arraycopy method that you can use to efficiently copy data from one array into another:
public static void arraycopy(Object src, int srcPos,
                             Object dest, int destPos, int length)

The two Object arguments specify the array to copy from and the array to copy to. 
The three int arguments specify the starting position in the source array, the starting position in the 
destination array, and the number of array elements to copy.

The following program, ArrayCopyDemo, declares an array of char elements, spelling the word "decaffeinated". 
It uses arraycopy to copy a subsequence of array components into a second array:

class ArrayCopyDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char[] copyFrom = { 'd', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'f', 'f', 'e',
			    'i', 'n', 'a', 't', 'e', 'd' };
        char[] copyTo = new char[7];

        System.arraycopy(copyFrom, 2, copyTo, 0, 7);
        System.out.println(new String(copyTo));
    }
}

The output from this program is:
caffein
